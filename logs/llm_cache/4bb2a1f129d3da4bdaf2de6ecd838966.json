{"response": "Insufficient data.\n\nEVIDENCE:\n- Source 1: Current literature on automation and process optimization often discusses the integration of robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies to streamline workflows. However, specific details about \"current\" automation processes without a defined industry or context are not extensively documented.\n- Source 2: Various case studies in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and retail describe the implementation of automation tools but do not provide a comprehensive overview of all current automation practices across different sectors.\n- Notes: The task requires more specificity regarding which sector or industry's current automation processes need to be reviewed. Without this context, it is challenging to provide an accurate summary."}
